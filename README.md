Abstract:

This paper analyzes the relationship between global trade and biodiversity. The preservation of biodiversity is crucial for the health of our planet and the survival of countless species, but the relationship between global trade and biodiversity is often overlooked in academic discussions. Researchers encounter difficulty in calculating a reliable biodiversity index. Therefore, this paper presents a simplistic solution for geographic and taxonomic bias while utilizing the GBIF dataset, which provides billions of observations. Furthermore, the main question this study aims to answer is: Do sustainable clauses positively affect biodiversity? To answer this question, a two-way fixed-effects model is conducted with the biodiversity index constructed with the GBIF dataset and LPI Index as dependent variables and the number of commitments taken by countries during a trade agreement. The results encountered show that more commitments do not implicate more biodiversity preservation. On the contrary, the more commitments taken, the less biodiversity will be preserved. Thus, the results encountered by this research are important to further enrich the literature on environment and trade.
