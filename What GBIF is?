GBIF—the Global Biodiversity Information Facility—is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments and aimed at providing anyone, anywhere, open access to data about all types of life on 
Earth.

Coordinated through its Secretariat in Copenhagen, the GBIF network of participating countries and organizations, working through the participant nodes, provides data-holding institutions around the world with common 
standards, best practices and open-source tools enabling them to share information about where and when species have been recorded. This knowledge derives from many different kinds of sources, including everything 
from museum specimens collected in the 18th and 19th century to DNA barcodes and smartphone photos recorded in recent days and weeks.

The network draws these diverse data sources together through the use of data standards, 
including Darwin Core, which forms the basis for the bulk of GBIF.org's index of hundreds of millions of species occurrence records. Publishers provide open access 
to their datasets using 
machine-readable Creative Commons licence designations, allowing scientists, researchers and others to apply the data in nearly five peer-reviewed publications every day, 
along with other reports, analyses and policy documents.

Each year, the GBIF Governing Board reviews and approves an annual work programme for the Secretariat that is bounded by a five-year strategic framework.





GBIF arose from a 1999 recommendation by the Biodiversity Informatics Subgroup of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Megascience Forum. This report concluded that "An international mechanism 
is needed to make biodiversity data and information accessible worldwide", arguing that this mechanism could produce many economic and social benefits and enable sustainable development by providing sound scientific 
evidence.
